I'm throwing away my mouse. I don't know why. It just seems like the kind of constraint that might actually make me interested in carving new brain channels into my hardening digital interior. Plus, I like shortcuts. Always have. Always will. So, I'm going to put together some resources for those who, like me, are trying to forego the clicking of forefingers.

## MacOs

Note that s- commands denote a command key prefix. So, for example, `s-G` translates to `COMMAND-SHIFT-G`

## Some Idioms

- `s-[` :arrow_right: go back a step 
- `s-]` :arrow_right: go forward a step

### MacOs Finder

- `s-G` :arrow_right: to a folder

### Alfred

### Karabiner

### The Interwebs

### Google Chrome

- `s-d` :arrow_right: bookmark page
- `s-D` :arrow_right: bookmark all tabs (why, though?)

- [Web Search Navigator](https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator) --> click Google search results using vim-like key bindings.
