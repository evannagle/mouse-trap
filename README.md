![Don't Click Me](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcoTKhfDvStjxMA/source.gif)

I'm throwing away my mouse. I don't know why. It just seems like the kind of constraint that might actually make me interested in carving new brain channels into my hardening digital interior. Plus, I like shortcuts. Always have. Always will. So, I'm going to put together some resources for those who, like me, are trying to forego the clicking of forefingers.

## MacOs

Note that s- commands denote a command key prefix. So, for example, `s-G` translates to `COMMAND-SHIFT-G`

### MacOs Finder

* `s-G` Go to a folder

## The Interwebs

### Google

* [Web Search Navigator](https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator) - click on search result links using vim-like key bindings.
