I'm throwing away my mouse. I don't know why. It just seems like the kind of constraint that might actually make me interested in carving new brain channels into my hardening digital interior. Plus, I like shortcuts. Always have. Always will. So, I'm going to put together some resources for those who, like me, are trying to forego the clicking of forefingers.

## Apt-Get Your Bearings

Note that this project is broken up into a list of **systems**. These are electronic operating systems that we, as people with non-digital digits, are forced to tinker within. Examples include MacOs, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

Each system contains a list of *tasks*. A task is any piece of work done or undertaken for the sake of avoiding another more ominous task. Examples include "googling for cat photos", "responding to an e-mail with, 'please refresh your browser'," etc.

Each task contains a list of one or more **macros**. A *macro* is loosely defined as *a series of keystrokes that enables a lowly humanesque oddity to perform a particular digital task without resorting to any electronic rodent appendage*.
